            When I'm not coding, I like to spend my time watching movies, playing videogames, listening to music and podcasts, 
            painting, and learning.
            <br></br>
            My top three movies are currently <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, 
            <em> Grand Budapest Hotel</em>, and <em> Raid 2</em>. I wouldn't blame anyone for not liking any of these
            but I think they are each so entertaining and stylistic. I think they are best watched going in cold so I dont recommend trailers!
            <br></br>
            My go-to shows to put on in the background are <em> It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia </em> and <em> New Girl</em>.
            I've seen both of these shows at least 8 times through which means I can just listen to them while cleaning. If you 
            haven't seen New Girl you're missing out, I assumed I wouldn't like it from the title but it's a remarkably funny show. 
            <br></br>
            Video games are a guilty pleasure of mine. I've been trying to prioritize creative hobbies over consumption based ones like watching
            shows or playing games, but when I do choose to play them I gravitate towards games like <em> no-build Fortnite</em>,<em> Valorant</em>,<em> and Clash of Clans</em>.
