This is a small project that I did for fun to learn a bit more about python and
problem solving. Initially, this started as a script that only returned words 
that used every letter the user provided. I decided it would be fun to expand 
it and include every word that could be made with any subset of letters the 
user provides. The following is the process I decided on to make this project
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I started with a 
<a href="http://www.mieliestronk.com/wordlist.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <b>list</b> </a>
of every english word. Then I wrote two python scripts to organize the words in one file from shortest to
longest then alphabetically and longest to shortest then alphabetically in the other. 
Then in another script I used a nested for loop to go through all 58,000 words longest to shortest and compare
them to every shorter or equal length word. In the comparison, a loop checked if
the every letter in the short word could be found in the long word. If all letters were found
somewhere in the long word, the word is added to the value of the long word's key.
When all comparisons were done, the script exported the dictionary as a json file.
This json file was used to fill an SQL database
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Currently, when letters are submitted to the field, it changes the value of the input
element named <i> sorted </i>. This change is reflected in the URL. When this page is
loaded, Flask checks if sorted has any value besides empty. if it has a value, 
my flask application will look for a key in the database equal to the value of sorted.
If found, the value of that key will be returned to an element on the page.
If a key with that value can't be found, then there are no words that can be
made from those letters, and the page will refect that.
